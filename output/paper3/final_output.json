The most prominent transitions observed in the decay chain under study in the present work, which pass through the low-spin isomer of 70 Co, are shown as blue arrows. The green arrow shows the dominant transition from the high-spin isomeric state, observed in Spyrou et al. 20 The inset shows the configurations of the two relevant J \u03c0 = 1 + states in 70 Co. The label r represents the group of orbitals (0 f 5 / 2 , 1 p 3 / 2 , 1 p 1 / 2 ) . Open circles represent hole states within the orbitals; x's represent states occupied by a particle excited across a shell gap. Symbols placed between orbitals indicate that configurations involving hole states in either orbital are possible. States interpreted as having a weakly deformed (WD) character are labeled with a white spherical shape, while states interpreted as having a strongly deformed (SD) character are labeled with a purple prolate shape (further details in text). All values are taken from the A=70 Nuclear Data Sheets 21 , and the J \u03c0 value of the long-lived \u03b2 -decaying state in 70 Co has been reassigned to 1 + in accordance with Morales et al. 17 and the Discussion within the Results section.",

In the case of Fe, the transition is observed to be a very small one, with the highest transition occurring at the end of its decay cycle. This transition occurs at a time when the electron is in an unstable state. It is possible that the electrons are in this unstable condition because of their high energy state and their low energy states. However, this is not the only possible",

In the case of Fe, the transition to a high spin is observed to occur at a rate of about 1.5 times the rate at which the electrons are deforming. This is because the energy of electrons is proportional to their mass. However, in order to obtain a constant energy, electrons must be de"
